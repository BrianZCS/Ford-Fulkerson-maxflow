# Ford-Fulkerson-maxflow

The input will start with a positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance,
there will be two positive integers, indicating the number of nodes n = |V | in the graph and the number
of edges |E| in the graph. Following this, there will be |E| additional lines describing the edges. Each
edge line consists of a number indicating the source node, a number indicating the destination node, and
a capacity. The nodes are not listed separately, but are numbered {1 . . . n}.

Your program should compute the maximum flow value from node 1 to node n in each given graph.

I implements the wrapper class for Graph and Edge and improve the complexity from the Matrix version.
